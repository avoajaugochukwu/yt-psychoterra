// The single place that decides what a job's state IS.
//
// Both the queue list (`/api/jobs`) and the per-job page (`/api/jobs/[taskId]`)
// call this, so a row and its page can never disagree. That mattered enough to
// centralise: the old queue showed a finished-prebake job as "Ready", which
// reads as "ready for YOU to render" — and the render had in fact already been
// started automatically. One click there bought a second copy of a multi-hour
// video (CHANGELOG 2026-07-30).
//
// Derived on READ, never stored. A stored copy goes stale the moment Modal
// finishes, and nothing writes back to the row after the worker lets go.
